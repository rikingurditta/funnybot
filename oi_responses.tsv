Timestamp	The name you want me to use for you	What is your favourite of these colours?	What's the worst place you would eat food from?	Have you ever shoplifted?	How do you define your sexuality?	What's your star sign	Which theoretical star sign do you vibe with the most	Gay son or thot daughter?	Relative to your siblings, you are:	When's the last time you got angry?	Which do you think you could take in a fight? (If you can fight both, whichever you'd beat more handily)	Which member of One Direction do you think would like you the most	If Jigsaw abducted you and put you in a SAW trap, what would you be willing to do to escape? (Assume that you will not die given your choice)	How many unique slurs (targeting real marginalized groups) can you name in 10 seconds, go.	You're awake at 6am. You:	If a spider appeared next to you what would you do?	Tim's or Starbucks?	What's the most complex piece of IKEA furniture/paraphernalia that you could assemble?	More of your friends are:	You usually start eating when you're:	What is the most benign household object you think you would be able to kill an intruder with?	How good are you at keeping secrets?	Which would you rather eat?	What's your tolerance for puns?	Which person in your household is in charge of shoveling in the winter?	What's the fanciest way you're able to enter a pool?	Who's better?	Would you say you're more book smart or street smart? You have to pick one	How long would it take you to split open a cantaloupe with only your bare hands (you may not use your mouth)?	Which of these things annoys you the most?	When did you peak?	If you saw emergency vehicles and people running away from them, what would you be most likely to do?	Be honest, do you know the times tables up to 12x12?

Timestamp	The name you want me to use for you	If you were in a Ratatouille situation, who would you prefer to be?	What's your biggest fear?	How long does it take you to get ready in the morning?	Do you have, or have you ever had, a driver's license?	If you were a university professor, would you be a Red Bull professor or a Gatorade professor?	I have ranked the following OI members in order of (my perception of) their physical strength, increasing from top to bottom. Who's the strongest you think you could beat in a fight?  Tough luck if you haven't met them I guess, just choose based on vibes	Salt or pepper?	Have you ever shoplifted?	What's your favourite kind of ice?	Which kind of torture would be more effective on you?	What is your favourite of these colours?	Do you wear glasses or contacts?	How good are you at getting people to listen to you?	Would you rather eat one bug (that I choose) or twenty bugs (that we choose together)?	If you were one of these foods, which one would you be?	Stripper?	Given the choice, what do you prefer to do for your birthday?	Would you rather wear a hat or shoes?	If you were in a gang, what would your role be?	What's the worst place you would eat food from?	What's your favourite element?	Truth or dare?	Consider the following situation: you put on a sock in the morning and discover it is filled with Vaseline. Unbeknownst to you, someone has filled all of your socks with Vaseline. You are not able to look at the socks, you can only tell whether they are filled with Vaseline by trying them on your foot. How many socks would you try on before accepting that they are probably all filled with Vaseline?	In the previous situation with the socks, what would you do once you figured out all your socks were full of Vaseline?	How do you define your sexuality?	How do you define your gender?	How fast can you solve a Rubik's cube?	Be honest do you think you're better than me?	How long did you spend on the survey?
